  faq:
    - q: "What is Nextcloud?"
      a: "Nextcloud is a private file sync server, among other things. You can use the default Saber Nextcloud server, use a third-party server, or self-host your own for full control of your data."
    - q: "What is the encryption password?"
      a: |-
        The encryption password is used to encrypt your data before it is sent to the server. You choose it when you first login to Saber, and it's not related to your Nextcloud account/password.
        No-one can access your notes on the server without your encryption password. This also means that if you forget your encryption password, you will lose access to your data.
    - q: "Why use two passwords?"
      a: |-
        The Nextcloud password is used to access the cloud. The encryption password "scrambles" your data before it ever reaches the cloud.
        Even if someone gains access to your Nextcloud account, your notes will remain safe and encrypted with a separate password. This provides you a second layer of security to protect your data.
    - q: "How do I login if I use 2FA?"
      a: "Instead of your regular Nextcloud password, you'll need to create an \"app password\". You can do this in your Nextcloud settings under Security > Devices & sessions > Create new app password. Your encryption password is unaffected."
    - q: "Can I use the same password for both?"
      a: "Yes, but doing so is less secure. Since your Nextcloud password is sent to the server, someone with access to the server would be able to decrypt your notes. Only use the same password if you trust the server owner."

  faq:
    - q: "Will I lose my notes if I log out?"
      a: No. Your notes will remain both on your device and on the server. They won't be synced with the server until you log back in. Make sure syncing is complete before logging out so you don't lose any data (see the sync progress on the home screen).
    - q: "How do I change my Nextcloud password?"
      a: "Go to your server website and log in. Then go to Settings > Security > Change password. You'll need to log out and log back in to Saber after changing your password."
    - q: "How do I change my encryption password?"
      a: |-
        0. Make sure syncing is complete (see the sync progress on the home screen).
        1. Log out of Saber.
        2. Go to your server website and delete your 'Saber' folder. This will delete all your notes from the server.
        3. Log back in to Saber. You can choose a new encryption password when logging in.
        4. Don't forget to log out and log back in to Saber on your other devices too.
    - q: "How can I delete my account?"
      a: |-
        Tap on the "@:profile.quickLinks.deleteAccount" button above, and login if needed.
        If you are using the official Saber server, your account will be deleted after a 1 week grace period. You can contact me at adilhanney@disroot.org during this period to cancel the deletion.
        If you are using a third party server, there might not be an option to delete your account: you'll need to consult the server's privacy policy for more information.
