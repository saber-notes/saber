Go to your server website and delete your 'Saber' folder. This will delete all your notes from the server.\n\n3. Log back in to Saber. You can choose a new encryption password when logging in.\n\n4.

You can contact me at adilhanney@disroot.org during this period to cancel the deletion.\n\nIf you are using a third party server, there might not be an option to delete your account: you'll need to consult the server's privacy policy for more information."
