You choose it when you first login to Saber, and it's not related to your Nextcloud account/password.\n\nNo-one can access your notes on the server without your encryption password. This also means that if you forget your encryption password, you will lose access to your data."

This provides you a second layer of security to protect your data."

        {
          "q": "Can I use the same password for both?",
