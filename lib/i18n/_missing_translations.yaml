      - q: What is an encryption password? Why use two passwords?
        a: |-
          The Nextcloud password is used to access the cloud. The encryption password "scrambles" your data before it ever reaches the cloud.
          Even if someone gains access to your Nextcloud account, your notes will remain safe and encrypted with a separate password. This provides you a second layer of security to protect your data.
          No-one can access your notes on the server without your encryption password, but this also means that if you forget your encryption password, you will lose access to your data.
      - q: I haven't set an encryption password yet. Where do I get it?
        a: |-
          Choose a new encryption password and enter it above.
          Saber will generate your encryption keys from this password automatically.
      - q: Can I use the same password as my Nextcloud account?
        a: Yes, but keep in mind that it would be easier for the server administrator or someone else to access your notes if they gain access to your Nextcloud account.

      - q: What is an encryption password? Why use two passwords?
        a: |-
          The Nextcloud password is used to access the cloud. The encryption password "scrambles" your data before it ever reaches the cloud.
          Even if someone gains access to your Nextcloud account, your notes will remain safe and encrypted with a separate password. This provides you a second layer of security to protect your data.
          No-one can access your notes on the server without your encryption password, but this also means that if you forget your encryption password, you will lose access to your data.
      - q: I haven't set an encryption password yet. Where do I get it?
        a: |-
          Choose a new encryption password and enter it above.
          Saber will generate your encryption keys from this password automatically.
      - q: Can I use the same password as my Nextcloud account?
        a: Yes, but keep in mind that it would be easier for the server administrator or someone else to access your notes if they gain access to your Nextcloud account.

    - q: Will I lose my notes if I log out?
      a: No. Your notes will remain both on your device and on the server. They won't be synced with the server until you log back in. Make sure syncing is complete before logging out so you don't lose any data (see the sync progress on the home screen).
    - q: How do I change my Nextcloud password?
      a: Go to your server website and log in. Then go to Settings > Security > Change password. You'll need to log out and log back in to Saber after changing your password.
    - q: How do I change my encryption password?
      a: |-
        0. Make sure syncing is complete (see the sync progress on the home screen).
        1. Log out of Saber.
        2. Go to your server website and delete your 'Saber' folder. This will delete all your notes from the server.
        3. Log back in to Saber. You can choose a new encryption password when logging in.
        4. Don't forget to log out and log back in to Saber on your other devices too.
    - q: How can I delete my account?
      a: |-
        Tap on the "@:profile.quickLinks.deleteAccount" button above, and login if needed.
        If you are using the official Saber server, your account will be deleted after a 1 week grace period. You can contact me at adilhanney@disroot.org during this period to cancel the deletion.
        If you are using a third party server, there might not be an option to delete your account: you'll need to consult the server's privacy policy for more information.

      - q: What is an encryption password? Why use two passwords?
        a: |-
          The Nextcloud password is used to access the cloud. The encryption password "scrambles" your data before it ever reaches the cloud.
          Even if someone gains access to your Nextcloud account, your notes will remain safe and encrypted with a separate password. This provides you a second layer of security to protect your data.
          No-one can access your notes on the server without your encryption password, but this also means that if you forget your encryption password, you will lose access to your data.
      - q: I haven't set an encryption password yet. Where do I get it?
        a: |-
          Choose a new encryption password and enter it above.
          Saber will generate your encryption keys from this password automatically.
      - q: Can I use the same password as my Nextcloud account?
        a: Yes, but keep in mind that it would be easier for the server administrator or someone else to access your notes if they gain access to your Nextcloud account.

    faq:
    - q: Will I lose my notes if I log out?
      a: No. Your notes will remain both on your device and on the server. They won't be synced with the server until you log back in. Make sure syncing is complete before logging out so you don't lose any data (see the sync progress on the home screen).
    - q: How do I change my Nextcloud password?
      a: Go to your server website and log in. Then go to Settings > Security > Change password. You'll need to log out and log back in to Saber after changing your password.
    - q: How do I change my encryption password?
      a: |-
        0. Make sure syncing is complete (see the sync progress on the home screen).
        1. Log out of Saber.
        2. Go to your server website and delete your 'Saber' folder. This will delete all your notes from the server.
        3. Log back in to Saber. You can choose a new encryption password when logging in.
        4. Don't forget to log out and log back in to Saber on your other devices too.
    - q: How can I delete my account?
      a: |-
        Tap on the "@:profile.quickLinks.deleteAccount" button above, and login if needed.
        If you are using the official Saber server, your account will be deleted after a 1 week grace period. You can contact me at adilhanney@disroot.org during this period to cancel the deletion.
        If you are using a third party server, there might not be an option to delete your account: you'll need to consult the server's privacy policy for more information.
