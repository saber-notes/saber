				"q": "What is the encryption password?",
				"a": "The encryption password is used to encrypt your data before it is sent to the server. It is not stored on the server, and is only used by Saber to encrypt and decrypt your data.\n\nNo-one can access your notes on the server without your encryption password. This also means that if you forget your encryption password, you will lose access to your data."
			},
			{
				"q": "Why use two passwords?",
				"a": "The Nextcloud password is used to access the cloud. The encryption password \"scrambles\" your data before it ever reaches the cloud.\n\nEven if someone gains access to your Nextcloud account, your notes will remain safe and encrypted with a separate password. This provides you a second layer of security to protect your data."
