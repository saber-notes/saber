# Pricing

The app is free to use. However, to support Saber's development and fund the server,
I'm offering some storage plans for the Saber Nextcloud server...

| Sponsorship | Storage                                                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Free        | All accounts by default get 5GB of storage.            |
| Standard    | Sponsor me _any amount_ per month for 10GB of storage. |
| Premium     | Sponsor me $5 or more per month for 50GB of storage.   |
| Hoarder     | Sponsor me $7 or more per month for 100GB of storage.  |

All sponsorships are in USD ($) because of GitHub Sponsors.

## How to sponsor

- Go to https://github.com/sponsors/adil192
- Select the amount you want to sponsor me per month
- Enter your card details
- Email me at adilhanney@disroot.org with your Nextcloud username and
  confirmation of your sponsorship, and I'll upgrade your account!

## I'm a student

If you're a student, you can get the Standard plan for free! Just email me at
adilhanney@disroot.org with your Nextcloud username and confirmation of your
student status (e.g. a screenshot of your UNiDAYS iD),
and I'll upgrade your account!

# Other options

- You can see a community maintained list of alternative Nextcloud providers here, 
  many of which offer free plans: https://github.com/nextcloud/providers#providers.
- You could also self-host a Nextcloud server. See https://nextcloud.com/install/#instructions-server
